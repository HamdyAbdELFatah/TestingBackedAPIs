# TestingBackedAPIs
Is a simple Application to meke request from APIs by get and post methode

## Built With ðŸ› 
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [HttpURLConnection](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html) - nstance is used to make a single request but the underlying network connection to the HTTP server may be transparently shared by other instances. Calling the close() methods on the InputStream or OutputStream of an HttpURLConnection after a request may free network resources associated with this instance but has no effect on any shared persistent connection. Calling the disconnect() method may close the underlying socket if a persistent connection is otherwise idle at that time.

- [SQLite DB](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/sqlite) - Saving data to a database is ideal for repeating or structured data, such as contact information. This page assumes that you are familiar with SQL databases in general and helps you get started with SQLite databases on Android
